# CUBE

The goal of my portfolio project is to spreading knowledge about NFTs. To teach anybody from novice or advanced beginner how to buy or sell an NFT. It's something I've been really interested in in recent years.

## Features

##### Favicon

![Favicon](docs/features/Favicon-Image.png)

- This Site features a favicon of the cube in the hero image reduced in size.

##### Home

![Home](docs/features/Home-Section.png)

- The home section features a responsive navigation bar and a hero image. The text to the left of the hero image informs the user straight away what the site is intended for. Once I put background-size: cover on the original photo so that on screen sizes such as 5000px the image would look perfect the background image was then too centered, there was too much empty space to the right hand side which didn't look good. With that in mind the original photo was edited using [PhotoScissors](https://photoscissors.com/) so that the cube would sit to the right of the screen and the text would be on the left. The original photo itself is then used on the smaller 480px screens so that the cube is more centered and can be seen on all screen sizes. 

##### About

![About](docs/features/About-Section.png)

- The About page features an eye catching logo in the center, with a complimenting color to the rest of the site, image was taken from [IstockPhoto](https://www.istockphoto.com/) To the left of the logo is Our Aim, letting the user know what we aim to do. To the right of the logo it informs the user what they will learn from signing up to the website. The About section uses flex, this made it a very easy and smooth experience when reducing the screen size for smaller devices, it looks just as good on all screens. At the very bottom there is an SVG wave, sticking with the same color palette as the website and making a nice flow into the Gallery section.

##### Gallery

![Gallery](docs/features/Gallery-Section.png)

- The Gallery section uses the same color as the botoom of the SVG wave, using [HTML-color-codes](https://html-color-codes.info/colors-from-image/) to get the exact color from the SVG image, so they flow nicely into eachother. The Gallery consists of some of the top NFT projects to date. These are the most popular amongst the NFT community and some of the most expensive to aquire. Like the About section the Gallery section also uses flex, it reduces the images very smoothly on smaller screens and looks just as pleasing to the eye.

##### Sign-up Form

![Sign-up](docs/features/Sign-up-Section.png)

- The Sign-up Form section has a dismanteled cube background image which I really liked the look of and the colors compliment the sites color palette, the image was taken from [ShutterShock](https://www.shutterstock.com/). The form was used from the challenge 1 & 2 I did for the [Love Running](https://code-institute-org.github.io/love-running-2.0/index.html) project, I removed code I didn't want to use for mine and altered code to better suit my site.

##### Footer

![Footer](docs/features/Footer-Section.png)

- The Footer section has the same color as the main headings on the page aswell as the sign-up button on the form, so that they all compliment eachother very well. The footer has copyright info that protects business copyright. It also has social media links and icons with links, as the screen size reduces for smaller devices only the icons are shown so its important they also bring the user to the social media site when clicked.

### Features to Implement in the Future

In the future, I would like to add more pages to the website. I would also like to add the 'smooth-scrolling' feature and make the Gallery a slideshow feature which I think would add a little extra to the website.
